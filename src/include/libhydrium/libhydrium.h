/**
 * @brief Provide a buffer of RGB pixel data to the hydrium encoder for it to encode.
 *
 * By default, hydrium encodes one tile at a time, and no tile references any other tile. A tile is 256x256,
 * unless tile_size_shift_x and/or tile_size_shift_y are set to something positive. In that case, the size of a
 * tile will be WxH, where W is (256 << tile_size_shift_x) and H is (256 << tile_size_shift_y).
 *
 * This function accepts an array of three buffers of pixel data, although they may overlap.
 *
 * The X and Y coordinates of the tile passed refer to the coordinates in numbers of tiles,
 * not in numbers of pixels, and starts from the upper left and proceeds in raster order.
 * For example, the tile immediately to the right of the upper-left tile has x=1 and y=0.
 *
 * The buffer passed treats buffer[0] as the red channel, buffer[1] as the green channel,
 * and buffer[2] as the blue channel. In the case where these buffers are all distinct, you probably
 * wish to set pixel_stride to 1, as each sample will be next to the previous sample. row_stride
 * is the pointer difference between two rows of a buffer.
 *
 * If you wish to pass packed data instead of planar data, set buffer[0] to the first red sample,
 * set buffer[1] to the first green sample, and set buffer[2] to the first blue sample. The distance
 * between adjacent red samples will be 3 in this case, so set pixel_stride to 3, not to 1. Row-stride
 * is the pointer difference between two rows of this buffer, as before, so buffer[0] + row_stride will
 * point to the first red sample in the second row of the tile.
 *
 * Note that the stride arguments are in units of samples, not bytes. Do not double them for 16-bit input, as
 * C already handles that when you add pointers.
 *
 * If the encoded tile does not fit in the remaining provided output buffer, HYD_NEED_MORE_OUTPUT is returned.
 * If so, you must call hyd_release_output_buffer to regain ownership of the output buffer. Do whatever with the
 * data (fwrite, send to a network stream, whatever), and then you must provide another output buffer with
 * hyd_provide_output_buffer. After you provide another output buffer, do not send the same tile again, instead
 * call hyd_flush to flush the remaining encoded tile to the output buffer.
 *
 * Tiles are always multiples of 256x256, although images are not always a multiple of 256 pixels in each direction.
 * If so, the rightmost column and bottom-most row of tiles will be smaller. Make sure you set row_stride correctly
 * for the right-most column, as hydrium will not automatically assume it is smaller than the one provided. Because
 * the image width and height were provided with hyd_set_metadata, hydrium will know how big these tiles should be
 * and it will not overrun the buffers.
 *
 * If the encoded tile is fully written to the output buffer, then HYD_OK will be returned, and it
 * is time to send another tile. Tiles may be sent in any order, although libhydrium will assume that the
 * lower-right tile is the last tile. Passing 0 or 1 to is_last will explicitly tell libhydrium if the sent tile is
 * the last one - otherwise, pass a negative value to use the above default behavior. Sending another tile
 * after the last one is undefined behavior.
 *
 * Any tile except the last one may be left unsent, and these gaps will be populated by zeroes.
 *
 * If the last tile is sent and the output buffer is not full, HYD_OK is returned. Any return value other than
 * HYD_NEED_MORE_OUTPUT or HYD_OK is an error.
 *
 * The sample format may vary from tile to tile. Internally, libhydrium will scale uint8_t samples, assumed to be
 * full-range between 0 and 255, to float values between 0.0 and 1.0. uint16_t samples will be scaled from the full
 * range of 0 to 65535, to float values between 0.0 and 1.0. To pass out-of-gamut colors you must pass float samples
 * less than 0.0 or more than 1.0, as float samples when passed are not rescaled. However, it is undefined behavior
 * to pass infinite or NaN float samples.
